<p>But of course, the manga has moved ahead of the anime, in terms of content, enticing anime fans to pick up the medium itself whilst others wonder if the aot manga really is better than the anime. Hajime isayama�s attack on titan is a hugely popular shounen manga with an anime series, but the adaptation process led to quite a few changes.

<p>Hey guys i was just wondering if i should continue reading attack on titan. 10 differences between the anime &amp; the manga. Menurut saya, versi manga dan anime nggak mungkin sama karena mereka ditampilkan dalam medium yang berbeda. Manga can never achieve that because anime has music and voice acting. Read the topic about attack on titan: I read fullmetal alchemist, never watched the (brotherhood) anime, only parts of the first anime adaptation.
