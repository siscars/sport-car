Amateur ou professionnel, notre entreprise familiale est à vot Sports don�t always have to be competitive and if your view is different then i can say dance can be be competitive too. And dance is not a sport it s just an art. Dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers into something that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves.

<p>Dance is an art because with dance you are able to tell a story without using your mouth. In my point of view, dance is both, dance is an art and a sport, because when you are dancing, you can exercise a lot of muscles, dancing is an activity beneficial to your health, on the other hand, dance is an art because art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting. (noun) an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others. If someone was to ask you if you belong to a sports team and you answered, i’m on a dance team”, they’d tell you that dance is not a sport but it is an art. Dancesport art studios offers the ultimate ballroom dance experience for all ages and abilities, for individuals, couples or groups. Many people don’t consider dance to be a sport because of the frilly costumes and the artistic aspects. Lateindress‬ ‪‎Ballroom‬ ‪‎Show‬ ‪‎RSG‬ ‪‎RSGdress.</p>
