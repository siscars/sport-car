<p>Although, we would like to consider including those characters with extensive potential to surpass some of the characters in the top 12; Meruem was the king of the chimera ants. Ging freecs is the same guy who’s considered as the top 5 strongest nen users. How this guy went from a mindless killing machine to barely even wanting to fight netero and wanting to protect and love a human is the work of the gods. Otherwise, it’ll leave their bodies in no time. Hunter x hunter is set in a world where hunters exist to perform all manner of dangerous tasks like capturing criminals and bravely searching for lost treasures in uncharted territories.
