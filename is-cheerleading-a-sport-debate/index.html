<p>Every cheerleader gets fired up when someone tries to argue with them that cheerleading is not a sport. Surely if golf is a sport then something actually requires an athletic ability as such cheerleeding should be considered a sport as well. It’s just cheerleading.” on july 21, 2010 the federal courts ruled cheerleading not a sport. However, cheerleading can become a sport over time if more cheer squads become competitive. Cheerleading is a team sport, so it allows individuals to come together and achieve the one common goal which is to win. Whether it’s a football player in one of your classes, a teacher who talks down about cheerleading, or a friend who doesn’t understand why you’re not involved in something else “more athletic,” you want people to know that cheerleaders are athletes. Why team sports really do improve grades Link between.</p>
